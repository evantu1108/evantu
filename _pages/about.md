<p> Hi! I'm currently a second-year MSCS student at University of California, San Diego (UCSD). I received a bachelor degree of computer science at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and a bachelor degree of electrical computer engineering in Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Currently, I'm advised by professor <a href = 'https://www.haojianj.in'> Haojian jin </a> and professor <a href = 'https://lilywenglab.github.io'> Lily Weng </a>. During my undergrad, I'm lucky enough to be advised by professor <a href = 'https://umich-foreseer.github.io'> Qiaozhu Mei </a> and <a href='https://jiaqima.github.io'> Jiaqi Ma </a>. </p>

<p>Broadly, my work centers on the following two aspects of trustworthy machine learning, especially in the context of LLM reasoning capabilities:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Privacy</em>, such as <em> machine unlearning</em>, <em> data privacy </em>  </li>
  <li><em>Interpretability</em>, such as <em> data attribution</em>, <em> intrinsic interpretability </em> </li>
</ul>

<p style="color: red;">I am actively looking for PhD positions starting in Fall 2026. Please email me if you have relevant opportunities!</p>
